    "\n",
    "With recent US federal regulation legalizing hemp in all 50 states, the sales of CBD related products is a hot growth market. For states that have legalized hemp & marijuana, usage by demographics (primarily age) have been tabulated over the last few years.  With New York recently being affected by the new federal regulation enabling the growth/processing/sale of CBD (derived from hemp), there is an opportunity to open up a small chain of CBD-focused wellness shops in the Manhattan area. \n",

    "The question becomes:  in which Manhattan neighborhoods should we strive to open 2-3 stores?\n",

    "The people who would be interested in this analysis would be entreprenuers who are interested in the CBD industry."

    "In order to understand which neighborhoods would be best suited for our CBD-focused wellness shops, we should incorporate the following into our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the rate of usage and average spend for various age groups?\n",
    "    - to support this part of the analysis, we'll reference this article: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/us/california-today-marijuana-consumers-by-the-numbers.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the population density of the age groups (from the NY times article) in neighborhoods in Manhattan?  And what's the potential spend by neighborhood, resulting in the top 5 target neighborhoods for consideration?\n",
    "    - to support this, we'll leverage a download of the 2017 US Census by zipcode from FactFinder.census.gov\n",
    "    - we'll load this data into our environment, and pull out the population #s by age group to match the zipcodes\n",
    "    - we'll leverage neighborhood name to zipcode mapping to pull out Manhattan neighborhoods only, using: https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/appendix/neighborhoods.htm\t\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3.  Finally, we'll want to know if there are differences in the neighborhoods in Manhattan in terms of density of retail stores and pharmacies, as this would indicate healthy shopping districts in which a CBD-wellness store could be located.\n",
    "    - to support this, we'll pull data from Foursquare for the top 5 neighborhoods (as identified by revenue potential from the analaysis done in steps 1 and 2 above).  We'll then analyze the # of retail stores\n",
    "      and existing pharmacies in the top 5 neighborhoods, to settle on 2-3 final neighborhoods where revenue potential is high, there appear to be appropriate overall densities of retail stores combined with lower\n",
    "      numbers of pharmacies (indicating lower potential competition for the CBD-wellness store)"
